# MongoDB

Install and run MongoDB locally with a database named "teddy" and a collection named "players"

https://docs.mongodb.com/guides/server/install/

In project root run:

```bash
yarn
```

to install deps then

```bash
yarn dev
```

To start the app. Hot reloading is not working, so you have to restart it when you make changes. So sorry.
